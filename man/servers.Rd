CKAN server URLS and other info
}
\details{
Comes from the links at http://ckan.org/instances

There were a number of other URLs for CKAN instances in the CKAN URL
above, but some sites are now gone completely, or if they do exist,
I can't figure out how to get access to the CKAN API on their instance.

# what version is each CKAN server running
out <- lapply(servers()[1:6], ckan_info)
vapply(out, "[[", "", "ckan_version")
